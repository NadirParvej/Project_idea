# Project Proposal: Child Vaccination Management System #
## Overveiw
Young children are at increased risk for infectious diseases because their immune systems have not yet built up the necessary defences to fight serious infections and diseases. Making sure that children have access to proper healthcare and immunization against diseases that can be prevented by vaccines, is a huge challenge that is being faced by developing countries like ours. This highlights the importance and need of having a better, smarter system in place, to improve the situations. This application provides a system to provide information, store records and help parents schedule vaccination appointments for their children. Our Child Vaccination Management System helps parents book vaccination appointments for their children with just a few clicks. Admin will manage the child and vaccination report and approval of the appointment. Hospitals will update the status of the vaccination applied for the child.

## Applied Waterfall Model - Design
Waterfall approach was first SDLC Model to be used widely in Software Engineering to ensure success of the project. In "The Waterfall" approach, the whole process of software development is divided into separate phases. In this Waterfall model, typically, the outcome of one phase acts as the input for the next phase sequentially.

The following illustration is a representation of the different phases of the Waterfall Model.

## 1. Requirements Analysis

In this phase, all requirements of the project are analysed and documented in a specification document and a feasibility analysis is done to check if these requirements are valid. It is essential to consider any limitations and constraints (e.g. time, budget constraints) which can affect the development process. After thorough analysis, a Requirements Understanding Documents (RUD) is created.

## 2. System Design

In this phase, the system design is prepared which specifies hardware and system requirements, such as data layers, programming languages, network infrastructure, user interface etc. 

## 3. Implementation

As the name implies, in this phase the source code is written as per requirements. The physical design specifications are turned into a working code. The system is developed in small programs called units, after which these units are integrated. Sometimes, functionality of each unit is tested before integration, which is called Unit Testing.

## 4. Testing

The code is then handed over to the testing team. Testers check the program for all possible defects, by running test cases either manually or by automation. The client is involved in the testing phase as well, in order to ensure all requirements are met. All Flaws and bugs detected during this phase are fixed to ensure Quality Assurance.

## 5. Deployment

In this phase, the software is deployed into a live environment (clientâ€™s server) in order to test its performance. Once the software is deployed, it becomes available to end-users. Sometimes, this phase also includes training of real-time users to communicate benefits of the system.

## 6. Maintenance

After the deployment phase, the next step is to provide support and maintenance for the software, making sure it runs smoothly. If the client and users come across errors/defects/bugs during use, fixing them is the main purpose of this stage.


All these phases are cascaded to each other in which progress is seen as flowing steadily downwards (like a waterfall) through the phases. The next phase is started only after the defined set of goals are achieved for previous phase and it is signed off, so the name "Waterfall Model". In this model, phases do not overlap.
